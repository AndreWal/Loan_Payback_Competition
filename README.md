# 🏦 Loan Payback Competition

This repository contains the code, experiments, and infrastructure for the **Kaggle Playground Series – Season 5, Episode 11** competition.  
The task is to predict whether a borrower will successfully repay a loan using a realistic, synthetic binary-classification dataset.

---

## 🔍 Overview
- Synthetic dataset generated from a deep-learning model trained on real loan-prediction data.  
- Goal: **predict loan repayment** based on borrower and loan attributes (e.g., income, debt ratio, credit history, loan purpose).  
- This repo implements an **end-to-end ML workflow**: data ingestion → EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → submission.
